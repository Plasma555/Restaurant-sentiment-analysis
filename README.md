# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project is a sentiment analysis model that scores reviews of various restaurants to determine their sentiment polarity (positive, negative). 
The model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and is trained on a dataset of restaurant reviews collected from multiple websites using the Instant Data Scraper tool.
The sentiment analysis model can be used to analyze customer feedback and gain insights into customer satisfaction for different establishments.
