Even simple things like coconut chutney dont taste like they used to, it has peanuts added in it now.
Sure on an absolute scale things are still palatable but it doesn't hold a candle to it's past self.
Mini tiffin quality has gone down, I think due to a change in chef/recipe the chinese items are also not up to the mark anymore especially the chilli paneer.
They have just focused on improving the seating and ambience but that is not what matters in a restaurant, the pricing has risen but that would not be an issue if at least the taste was like before.
Looks like they are on a disastrous path with their efforts to make it a more upscale establishment while compromising the authentic sangeetha taste.","","https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/system_gm/1x/thumb_up_gm_grey_18dp.png","Like","https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/system_gm/1x/share_gm_grey_18dp.png","Share","1"
